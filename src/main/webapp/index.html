<!--2) This is with Gradle since Spring Boot uses that now to build servers-->
<!--3) Gradle builds in project_name/build/libs folder...the asdf-SNAPSHOT.jar-->
<!--4) At project dir in cmd, do java -jar build\libs\AnimeRe...SNAPSHOT.jar-->
<!--5) Springboot builds a server at port 8080, v popular for Java servers,
      and listens and responds for/to any connection requests-->
<!--6) NodeJS are usually at 3000, Angular are usually at 4200, Flask 8000-->
<!--7) During the WebDev class we used mvn clean install to make the .jar exec...
      mvn different so we use Gradle via Spring Boot-->
<!--8) Note about git: The .git folder indicates the project is a git repo
      so we can keep track of the other things-->
<!--9) Other git note, I been doing git ops over HTTPS, so I need to refresh
        personal access tokens on Github-->
<!--10) So hey, how does index.html become the go-to launch page? Weeelll...
        ...Springboot references index.html by title and location in its
        launch explicitly, it's convention!-->
<!--11) What 10 means is that if I change the name n' location of index.html in
        Spring's launch code and index.html itself it'll run just the same-->
<!--12) By default it checks for index.html and other html in the...
        ...'webapp' folder. Could change that name also in the back for the...
        ...same effect. So webapp is the website proper and index.html is the...
        ... 'website.com/' as in the default page under no other reference-->
<!--13) Just as the world revolves around the sun, different pages revolve around
        index.html, and it's location-->
